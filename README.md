Responsive-Tumblr
=================

I hacked the default tumblr theme to be responsive. This means all the standard Tumblr customizations work.  

How to install:

Go to yourblog.tumblr.com (or its domain name if you are using a custom domain name and click customize. Select HTML and copy and paste the HTML contained in the document. Your accent color is supported, however the default font is not as it uses OpenSans as the default. All other features are supported.
